Hospital Appointment Booking Assistant Knowledge Base 
 
System Overview: 
This assistant is designed to help patients and hospital staff interact 
seamlessly with the hospital appointment booking system, which has been 
developed using Django and PostgreSQL for the backend and React, 
Bootstrap, and Lucide for the frontend. The system facilitates features 
such as booking appointments, viewing doctor schedules, processing 
payments, and tracking token numbers for patient visits. 
 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): 
 
1. How do I book an appointment? 
To book an appointment, log in to the system first. Once logged in, 
navigate to the "Book Appointment" section. From there, you can select a 
doctor, choose your preferred date and time, and select a payment method 
- either Pay Now or Pay Later. 
 
2. What happens after booking? 
After successfully booking an appointment, the system assigns you a 
unique token number. This number is based on the current day's queue and 
will be displayed immediately upon confirming or skipping the payment 
process. 
 
3. What are the payment options? 
You can choose between two payment options: Pay Now or Pay Later. If you 
select Pay Now, you will be redirected to a Razorpay UPI payment 
interface. If you select Pay Later, your appointment will be booked 
without processing a payment at that moment. 
 
4. What is the consultation fee? 
The standard consultation fee is ₹500. This fee is displayed clearly 
during the appointment booking process. 
 
5. How do I check my token number? 
Your token number will be shown after a successful appointment booking. 
It is also accessible in the "My Appointments" section for your 
reference. 
 
6. Can I view or cancel my appointments? 
Yes. After logging in, go to the "View Appointments" page to see a 
list of your scheduled appointments. Options for canceling or 
rescheduling can be implemented as needed. 
 
7. How do I know which doctors are available? 
When booking an appointment, the system automatically shows you the list 
of doctors and their available slots based on current scheduling data. 
 
8. What time should I arrive for my appointment? 
To ensure a smooth experience, it is recommended to arrive at least 
15-20 minutes before your token number is expected to be called.

Can I book for family members?
Yes. Add their profiles under the "Family Profiles" section and book on their behalf.

Doctor Schedule Information:

You can view available doctors and their schedules in the "Book Appointment" section.

Clicking on a doctor's name will show their profile, including specialization and working hours.


Technical Workflows: 
 
Authentication: 
The system uses JWT-based authentication. When a user logs in through the 
API endpoint (/api/token/), a JWT token is issued and stored in the 
browser's localStorage. This token is then attached to all subsequent 
API requests to access secured endpoints. 
 
Booking Flow: 
When a patient books an appointment, they select the doctor and the 
desired time slot. A POST request is sent to the backend endpoint 
(/api/book-appointment/) with the booking details. The backend calculates 
a unique token number based on the current date and number of existing 
appointments. If Pay Now is selected, Razorpay is invoked to handle the 
transaction. 
 
Payment Integration: 
Razorpay handles UPI-based payments on the frontend. Once the payment is 
initiated from the frontend (payment.js), the backend endpoint 
(/api/verify-payment/) handles the verification after redirection to 
confirm the transaction. 
 
Viewing Appointments: 
Users can fetch their appointments through the endpoint (/api/my-
appointments/), which returns a list of all bookings associated with the 
logged-in user. Appointments can be filtered based on date, status, or 
token number.


Medical Assistance Information:

What should I do if I have an emergency?
For medical emergencies, please call emergency services (ambulance) immediately 
or go to the nearest emergency room. Do not wait for an appointment or consultation.
Signs of emergency include severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe 
bleeding, sudden severe pain, major injuries, or loss of consciousness.

When should I see a doctor vs. use the chat assistant?
The chat assistant can help with basic symptom information, scheduling, and 
general hospital questions. However, it is not a substitute for medical advice.
You should consult a doctor for:
- Persistent symptoms that don't improve
- Worsening of any condition
- Any concerning new symptoms
- Medication questions or prescription needs
- Follow-up after treatments or procedures

How can I get help with identifying symptoms?
You can describe your symptoms to the chat assistant, which will provide 
general information about possible conditions and recommendations. For example:
"I've had a headache for two days and feel nauseous" or "My child has a fever 
and cough. What should I do?"

Which specialists are available at the hospital?
Our hospital has specialists in Cardiology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics, Dermatology,
Neurology, Gynecology, ENT, Ophthalmology, and General Medicine. You can ask
about specific department schedules or doctor availability.

What should I do before my appointment?
Before your appointment, prepare a list of your symptoms, when they started,
any medications you're taking, and questions you want to ask the doctor.
Bring any relevant medical records, previous test results, and your health
insurance information.
